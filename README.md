# steam-game-linker
WIP 

GOAL 
    To easily turn a steam game name/ list of games into a clickable reddit link from reddit markdown input.

WHY? 
    Because people have leftover game keys from online stores and I hope this will make things look nice and not create much extra work on the users end when creating a trade post on reddit.
