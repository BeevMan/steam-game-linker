# [steam-game-linker](https://beevman.github.io/steam-game-linker/)

Attempts to match a list of games to steamGames.json and return them in markdown ready links. (steamGames.json was obtained from [steam's api](https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/)) 

This projects main goal was trying to match HumbleBundle's naming convention to Steam's.

User input game names must be seperated by a linebreak.

## Want to easily gather your [HumbleBundle keys & entitlements](https://www.humblebundle.com/home/keys) list?

I made a [script](https://github.com/BeevMan/steam-game-linker/blob/master/scripts/hbKeyPgNameLister.js) for just that reason.  
You can run my script in the browsers console or you can install my browser extension.
