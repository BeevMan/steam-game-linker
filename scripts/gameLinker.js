	/*
	  TO DO,
	    X need to find how to access json, 
		 X search json by game name,
		   the games can currently be found but only with the same name and punctuation as listed in the JSON, for useability I should convert all letters to same case? Most names copied from hb keys list match however HIVESWAP: Act 1 doesn't match with the JSON because ACT is all capitilized 
		   need to remove Â® (copyright symbol)from the search & and possibly end the game name at : ? a few games seem to only match when the name before ":" is used example - Override: Mech City Brawl is only found with Override but HIVESWAP: ACT 1 is only found with the ":"
		X once appID is returned I can add it to https://store.steampowered.com/app/
		  X find reddits way of formatting links, [test link](https://www.google.com) must be inputted from markdown mode
		
        X need to seperate into 3 lists,  1. games found with a single match  2. games found with multiple matches   3. games with no matches found 
		  need to generate <li> elements for all 3 lists
		get it working for multiple names at a time
		  if the user has multiple copy of the same game I need to track that too?
        set it up to run locally i.e if hosted on a site, frontend javascript will call 	https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetAppList/v2/	or site updates list every so often? 
		need to add a status to the button to tell user's that it is busy working
        user's text input area currently starts one space in, need to remove that space
